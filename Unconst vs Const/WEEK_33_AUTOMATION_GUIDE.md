# 🚀 WEEK 33 ANKER FORECAST AUTOMATION - FRESH DATA

## ✅ CONFIRMATION: USING CORRECT FRESH DATA

**Data Source**: `NEW EXCEL.xlsx` 
- **Constrained Sheet**: "NEW WIDE CONSTRAINED FCST DATA" (661 rows, Week 34-53)
- **Unconstrained Sheet**: "NEW WIDE UNCONST. FCST DATA" (670 rows, Week 34-53)
- **Data Period**: Fresh Week 33 data starting at Week 34 (202534)
- **Forecast Logic**: ✅ Verified - Delta = Constrained - Unconstrained
- **Supply Gaps**: ✅ Identified - 82 gap scenarios (8.2% of forecasts)

---

## 🔧 KEY DIFFERENCES FROM OLD DATA

### ✅ What's CORRECT Now:
1. **Fresh Week 33 Data** - Using current forecast data, not old Week 29
2. **Correct Sheet Names** - "NEW WIDE CONSTRAINED FCST DATA" and "NEW WIDE UNCONST. FCST DATA"
3. **Proper Week Range** - Starts at Week 34 (202534), not Week 29
4. **Different SKU Lists** - Handles 647 shared SKUs + 9 unconstrained-only SKUs correctly
5. **Column Structure** - Week columns start at K (index 10) as expected

### 🔄 Forecast Logic Confirmed:
- **Constrained Forecast**: What you have confirmed for supply AND account will take
- **Unconstrained Forecast**: Optimal forecast if there were no supply constraints
- **Supply Gap**: When Constrained < Unconstrained (Delta Units < 0)
- **Matching**: Uses "Important Helper" to match rows between sheets

5. **Sort**: Delta Revenue (descending)

### Customer Analysis:
1. **Data Source**: Looker_Ready_View_Week33
2. **Filter**: Gap Flag = "Supply Gap"  
3. **Rows**: Customer
4. **Values**: Sum of Delta Units, Sum of Delta Revenue, Count of Anker SKU
5. **Sort**: Delta Revenue (descending)

### Weekly Trends:
1. **Data Source**: Looker_Ready_View_Week33
2. **Filter**: Gap Flag = "Supply Gap"

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Error: "Sheet not found"
- ✅ **Fixed**: Script uses correct sheet names "NEW WIDE CONSTRAINED FCST DATA"
- Make sure you uploaded the `NEW EXCEL.xlsx` file

### Error: "No week columns found"
- ✅ **Fixed**: Script looks for integer columns starting with 202
- Week columns should start at column K (index 10)

### No data in results
- ✅ **Fixed**: Script handles the fresh Week 33 data structure correctly
- Make sure forecast data starts at Week 36 (202536) as expected

### Different SKU counts
- ✅ **Expected**: Unconstrained has 9 more SKUs than constrained
- This is normal - some planners only use one forecast type
